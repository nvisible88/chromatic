# Changelog

## v0.1.2 — og.png live (2026-05-25)

- Generated and committed `og.png` (280KB, 1200×630). Social link previews now render on Twitter/X, iMessage, Slack, etc. Confirmed HTTP/2 200 at `nvisible88.github.io/chromatic/og.png`.

## v0.1.1 — P1/P2 bug fix pass (2026-05-25)

### Patch

- **Double-submit guard** — `submitScore()` now returns early if a request is already in-flight (`isSubmittingScore` flag); submit button is disabled during the fetch and re-enabled in `finally`.
- **Leaderboard refresh debounce** — `loadLeaderboard()` returns early if already loading (`isLoadingLeaderboard` flag); reset in `finally` covers the `!rows.length` early-return path inside the try block.
- **Remove debug `console.log`** — `console.log('endGame fired')` removed (Copilot artifact).
- **Country select placeholder** — `populateCountries()` now prepends a disabled `Select country…` option; `submitScore()` validates `country !== ''` with same pattern as name validation.
- **rAF leak on restart** — `startGame()` now cancels the previous `requestAnimationFrame` and all three advance timers on the old state before replacing it with `freshState()`.
- **Clipboard `.catch()`** — `shareResult()` clipboard path now chains `.then()` / `.catch()` so permission denial shows "Couldn't copy to clipboard." instead of silently failing.

### Failed approaches

- **rAF leak root cause:** the original `startGame()` assumed canceling timers was only needed between levels, not on full restart. The `tick` closure references the global `state` by name, not by value — so after `state = freshState()`, the old closure continued running and wrote new rAF handles into the *new* state on each frame. The new `startTimer` then canceled only the old loop's most-recently-registered handle, leaving the loop alive.

## v0.1 — MVP shipped (2026-05-25)

### Completed

- 30-level game with HSL-based difficulty curve
- Result screen with three sub-scores and six tier labels
- Supabase leaderboard, end-to-end working
- Top 50 leaderboard with flags
- Share card PNG generator (1080×1350)
- OG + Twitter Card meta tags
- OG image generator tool at `/tools/generate-og.html`
- GitHub Pages deployment
- Level-30 freeze bug fix (watchdog + try/catch in `scheduleLevelAdvance`)

### Failed approaches

- **First deploy was a 64-line placeholder stub.** The full game existed locally but was never copied over. Lesson: always verify file size and content after a "completed" file operation. Don't trust a completion claim without a sanity check.
- **First Supabase URL included a `/rest/v1/` suffix.** The client code prepends that itself — would have caused double-slash 404s. Lesson: bare project URL only.
- **First Supabase key was the new `sb_publishable_` format**, not the legacy JWT anon key. The client code uses standard JWT `Bearer` headers, so the `eyJ`-prefixed key is required.
- **First "fix" for the level-30 freeze didn't actually fix it.** Lesson: never claim a bug is fixed without reproducing the failure condition first.

### Decisions made

- Single HTML file, no build step. Zero deploy friction, ~44KB acceptable.
- HSL color space — perceptually intuitive deltas.
- Three sub-dimensions match the Farnsworth-Munsell test structure.
- Anon key in client code — it's designed to be public, RLS protects writes.
- Pre-game name capture deferred — risk of dropping conversion at the funnel top.

### Known limitations

- No anti-abuse on leaderboard inserts. Anyone can script high scores. Acceptable until v0.2.
- Percentile labels are marketing copy ("Top 4%"), not derived from real data.
- `og.png` not yet generated and committed — meta tag points to a 404.
- No mobile-specific smoke test on iOS Safari yet.

### Next (v0.2 candidates)

- Verify Copilot freeze-bug fix on the live site by reproducing the trigger condition
- Pre-game name + country capture
- Basic analytics (Plausible or Supabase-derived)
- Mobile smoke test
- Anti-abuse Edge Function (after first ~50 real submissions)
